Electric Vehicle Market Trends and Adoption Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle (EV) market trends and adoption patterns in Washington State. The goal is to understand key factors influencing the growth of electric vehicles, including the market share of different EV manufacturers, the distribution of BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) vs. PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles), regional adoption, and the impact of state policies. The project is implemented using Microsoft Excel for data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.

Project Objectives
EV Growth Trends: Analyze the increase in electric vehicle registrations over the years to identify patterns and trends.

BEV vs. PHEV Comparison: Compare the market share of BEVs and PHEVs to understand consumer preferences.

Regional EV Market: Explore the distribution of electric vehicles across various regions of Washington State.

Policy Impact: Analyze how state policies have affected the adoption of electric vehicles.

Visualization: Create various charts (line, column, doughnut, 2D column charts) and an interactive dashboard to visualize key data points.

Dynamic Analysis: Implement slicers and filters in the dashboard to allow users to interact with the data and explore different metrics.

Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: For data manipulation (Pivot Tables), creating various types of charts (Line, Column, Doughnut), and building an interactive dashboard.

Data Visualization: Includes dynamic visualizations like a filtered map, interactive charts, and dashboards.

Slicers and Filters: For user-interactive filtering of the data, allowing for dynamic analysis of EV market trends based on specific parameters.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes electric vehicle registration data from Washington State. It contains information about vehicle make, model year, registration counts, and more. The data was used to create various analyses, such as EV distribution by make, regional adoption, and comparison between BEVs and PHEVs.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure its accuracy and readiness for analysis.

EV Growth by Year: A line chart visualizing the annual growth of electric vehicle registrations.

BEV vs. PHEV Comparison: A column chart comparing the number of BEVs and PHEVs.

Regional EV Market: A 2D column chart showing the distribution of EVs across different regions.

Doughnut Chart: Used to show the market share of the top EV manufacturers.

Interactive Dashboard: A dashboard that consolidates all visualizations and allows users to filter the data dynamically with slicers.

Filtered Map: A dynamic map to visualize EV adoption in various districts of Washington State.
